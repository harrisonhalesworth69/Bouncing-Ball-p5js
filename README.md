# Bouncing-Ball-p5js
What you miss in CS 3: p5js project

Revision of Prof. Meng's file:
 * 1. 2022-11-29 Created a new function that rerandomizes the color for each ball and the box in the display each time the mouse is pressed
 * 2. 2022-11-29 Made it so that every time a ball hits the wall or the box, its speed is doubled, causing the balls to become so fast after a couple of collisions 
 * that they fly off the screen. Also every time the mouse is pressed, the balls become a random size as well
 * 3. 2022-11-29 The balls become so fast after a couple of collisions, so a new game comes of this where you see how long you can press the screen and move 
 * the balls before they are all gone!
